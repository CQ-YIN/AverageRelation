            <strong>Unravel the Emotional Distances in Relationships Through NFTs</strong> 
            <br>

            <strong>Valuing Bonds with a Measure of Distance</strong>
            <br>
            Distance is the ONLY unit here.
            <br> Each NFT artwork symbolizes different facets of human relationships. You are invited to assign a value to these relationships, not in terms of monetary worth, but as a measure of emotional distance. The valuation range is set from a minimum of 0.1 ETH to a maximum of 10 ETH, with only one decimal place allowed. 
            <br> The key lies in the interpretation: the lower the number, the closer and more intimate the relationship. To be clearer, valuing a relationship at 0.5 ETH suggests a closer bond, reflecting a lesser emotional distance.
